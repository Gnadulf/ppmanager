# Environment Variables Example
# 
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development:
#   cp env.example .env.local
#
# Then replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials

# Supabase Project URL
# Get this from: Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API > Project URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# Supabase Anonymous Key (public)
# Get this from: Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API > Project API keys > anon (public)
# This key is safe to use in a browser environment as it's meant to be public
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Important Notes:
# 1. Never commit .env.local to version control
# 2. The anon key is safe to expose in frontend code (it's designed for that)
# 3. For production deployment on Vercel, add these as environment variables in:
#    Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables
# 4. Make sure your Supabase project has Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
#
# Local Development:
# After creating .env.local, the app will automatically load these variables
# No additional configuration needed - just refresh your browser
